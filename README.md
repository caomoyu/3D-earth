# 3D-earth
3D earth with wind vector
a 3D earth with scattered topography and multiple pressure-level (currently until 900hPa) wind vectors (2023-01-01 monthly data). It's made by Python's plotly package, and I used the data from ERA5 and GMT topography. This script also requires a transformation of wind speed coordinates and a correction of the topography data, the radius of the earth is set to 63.71 km so that can highlight the aititude of wind vector(if the radius set to 6371km, the atmosphere will be very 'thin')
